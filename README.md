# arduino-route-tracking
This is an arduino software application that tracks the location of an 4WD car starting from a relative point, using esp32 board. 
Using this application will allow you to monitor the movement of a car module starting from an initial point.

# Requirements for this application:
  1 - 4WD car module.
  2 - microcontroller to be a medium between the esp32 and DC motor drivers.
  3 - Software application for the DC motor movement.
  4 - Serial communication between the esp32 and a control unit like a Bluetooth module.

follow along this application for more details.
